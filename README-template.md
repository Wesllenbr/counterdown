## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- JS

### What I learned

- Get the actual date and time with the object Date()
- Convert date format to milleseconds with getTime()
- Execute a function every time especified with setTimerOut()
- Stop a setTimerOut() function with clearTimer()
- Rotate a element in three-dimensional way with transform: rotateX() or rotateY() or rotateZ()
- Search for DOM(Document Obeject Model) elements that are being changed with MutationObserver()
- DOM is a programming interface for web documents
- To pad a start of a string with another string until it reaches a given length using padStart()

### Continued development

- Would be nice if this project becomed a real world project. A countdown for every holyday or date especific that you want, but in a way more friendly, more beautiful and with more features.
